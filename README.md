Files:

1. word2vec_example.py : this file is an example of implementing the neural network method, "Word2Vec" in python.  This is done on words, not ingredients.
    
2. word_importance.py : Fit a random forest to the full train set on words, not ingredients. At the end we sort the words by feature importance.  (Also, note that the 'wordVectorizer' function already filters out words occuring only once.)
